# Github Desktop & Gitkraken

Maybe you are troubled by the confusing Git Commands, especially Git push and Git pull in different situations. Fortunately, Git GUI allows users to make changes to their repository by making new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches, performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote repositories, which lowers study difficulty.

So why not try [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) ?

You can change the files in your local repository, and then submit the changes to remote repositor, by clicking buttons in the graphical interface.
